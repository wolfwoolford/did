# Did - what command *did* I run here again?

If you are a developer that runs lots of commands, 
in many different directories, and if sometimes you
find yourself scratching your head trying to
recollect a particularly long or complicated
command that you previously ran ... then scratch no
more! Simply:

source didrc

...
... lots of commands later
...

# developer thinks "what did I do?"
# solution:
did # exported function echoes local commands to stdout

Happy hacking!



Q: Where is the command history stored?
A: It's configurable, but defaults to /home/$USER/.did/
   - this is essential - you don't want your history
     ending up in tar balls or anything else you
     share 
   - delete this directory and you lose every logged
     command

Q: How does it spy?
A: It overwrites the PROMPT_COMMAND environment
   variable (The contents of this variable are executed 
   as a regular Bash command just before Bash displays
   a prompt).

Q: What is the format of the logged commands?
A: history_index command YYYYMMDD_HH:MM:SS command_return_code
   - Hopefully trivial to brew your own if not to your
     liking
