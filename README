# Did - what _did_ I do in this directory

Directory specific command line history.

Did is a directory specific command line history logger for Linux style 
terminals. Did prints every command ever run in the current directory
using a simple command : 'did'

Underneath the hood, did logs command history to a text file in a customisable location.

Typically usage pattern is
source path_to/didrc # i.e. in your .bashrc
echo hello world
did

Q: Where is the command history stored?
A: It's configurable, but defaults to /home/$USER/.did/
   - this is essential - you don't want your history
     ending up in tar balls or anything else you
     share. 
   - delete this directory and you lose every logged
     command.

Q: How does it capture command history?
A: It overwrites the PROMPT_COMMAND environment
   variable (The contents of this variable are executed 
   as a regular Bash command just before Bash displays
   a prompt).
