# Did - what command *did* I run here again?

If you are a developer that runs lots of commands, in many different directories,
and if sometimes you find yourself scratching your head trying to recollect a
particularly long or complicated command that you previously ran ... then scratch 
no more! Simply

source didrc

...
... lots of commands later
...

# developer thinks "what did I do?"
# solution:
did # exported function echoes local commands to stdout

Happy hacking!
