# Dish - what did I do in this directory?

DIrectory Specific command line History.

Dish is a directory specific command line history logger for bash  
terminals. Dish prints every command ever run in the current directory
using a simple command : 'dish'

Underneath the hood, dish logs command history to a text file in a customisable location.

Typically usage pattern is

host:/home/dave/test_dish
$ source /usr/share/dish/dishrc # or place in .bashrc
host:/home/dave/test_dish
$ echo hello world
hello world
host:/home/dave/test_dish
$ dish
1015  echo hello world 20160419_10:12:18 0
host:/home/dave/test_dish

Q: Where is the command history stored?
A: It's configurable, but defaults to $HOME/.dish/
   - this is essential - you don't want your history
     ending up in tar balls or anything else you
     share. 
   - delete this directory and you lose every logged
     command.

Q: How does it capture command history?
A: It overwrites the PROMPT_COMMAND environment
   variable (The contents of this variable are executed 
   as a regular Bash command just before Bash displays
   a prompt).
