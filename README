# Did - what command *did* I run in this directory?

Did is a directory specific command line history logger for Linux style 
terminals. It logs command history to a text file in a customisable
location and prints commands previously run in the current directory
using a simple command : 'did'


Typically usage pattern is

# in .bashrc or similar
source path_to/didrc
# that is all (the did command is an exported function, see didrc).


Q: Where is the command history stored?
A: It's configurable, but defaults to /home/$USER/.did/
   - this is essential - you don't want your history
     ending up in tar balls or anything else you
     share. 
   - delete this directory and you lose every logged
     command.

Q: How does it spy?
A: It overwrites the PROMPT_COMMAND environment
   variable (The contents of this variable are executed 
   as a regular Bash command just before Bash displays
   a prompt).

Q: What is the format of the logged commands?
A: history_index command YYYYMMDD_HH:MM:SS command_return_code.
   - Hopefully trivial to brew your own if not to your
     liking.
